Data-flow programming for SuperCollider?
========================================
This is an experiemental research project, exploring if and how one
can program [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net) using
[NoFlo UI](http://www.noflojs.org). This will hopefully allow to do
audio synthesis, sound processing and algorithmic using a visual data-flow
programming model.

Status
------
Wild idea

TODO
-----
* Write a simple WebSocket -> OSC bridge for NoFlo protocol (Node.JS)
* Figure out how to programatically list available UGens and Patterns
* Come up with a datastructure for components, nodes and graphsnet

Milestones
------------
* 0.0.1: Can create a synthdef composed of a couple of UGens, and play a synth using a simple Event or Pattern
